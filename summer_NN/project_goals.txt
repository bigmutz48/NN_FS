PROJECT GOALS:




GOALS: (what our project should do)
1) Make a program that classifies coordinates as either a correct solution to solve the networks equation
2) Make extensive use of CUDA libraries and do as much of the compute on the GPU as possible
3) graph all of the coordinates that the program classifies as correct







RULES: (rules for how we can build it)
1) No external packages related to AI (no pytorch no tensorflow)
2) Languages: C, C++, Python
